# NAIS-client

NAIS-client is an ultra-modern, lightweight IRC client written in Rust. This repository contains the initial scaffold and a TODO-driven plan.

Quick start (Linux):

```bash
cd nais-client
cargo build --release
./target/release/nais_client
```

Next steps:
- Implement async IRC core
- Add cross-platform GUI (Windows first)
